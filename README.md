# Chatbots

This repository contains various chatbots I built using Python, each designed for a specific purpose.

## 1. Job Interview Simulator
This folder contains a Python script that simulates a job interview using LangChain and OpenAI. The bot generates questions tailored to the job role and provided skills, creating a realistic interview experience.

## 2. Customer Service Assistant
This folder contains a Python script that builds a customer service assistant bot using Groq. The bot is deployed using Gradio and can handle typical customer service queries.

## 3. Travel Recommendation Bot
This folder contains a Python script that creates a travel recommendation bot powered by generative AI. The bot is deployed using Streamlit and helps users plan trips based on preferences.

### Usage

Each chatbot is contained in its own folder with a corresponding virtual environment. It is recommended to create separate virtual environments for each bot. You will need to use your own API keys to run them.
